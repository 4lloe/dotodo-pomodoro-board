## üèÅ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher recommended)
- npm or bun (or yarn)
- A running instance of a PostgreSQL database (or your preferred database configured in Prisma)

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/dotodo-pomodoro-board.git
    cd dotodo-pomodoro-board
    ```

2.  **Backend Setup:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install # or bun install or yarn install

    # Create a .env file in the backend directory based on .env.example (if available)
    # or configure the following environment variables:
    # DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
    # JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-jwt-key"
    # JWT_EXPIRATION_TIME="3600s" # Example: 1 hour

    # Apply database migrations
    npx prisma migrate dev

    # Seed the database (if a seed script is available)
    # npx prisma db seed

    npm run start:dev
    ```
    The backend server will start on `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured in your environment).

3.  **Frontend Setup:**
    Open a new terminal window.
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install # or bun install or yarn install

    # Create a .env file in the frontend directory if needed
    # Example:
    # VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend development server will start on `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port if 5173 is in use).

## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture:

-   **Frontend:** A single-page application (SPA) built with React and Vite. It handles user interaction, displays data, and communicates with the backend API.
-   **Backend:** A RESTful API built with NestJS. It manages business logic, interacts with the database (via Prisma), and handles authentication and authorization.
